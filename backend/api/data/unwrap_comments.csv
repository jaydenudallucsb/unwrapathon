"","reddit","Hi r/Slack!  
  
I recently got the bitter(sweet?) news that I am being laid off. Instead of brooding and trying my hand at another job, I thought this is the time I want to fully pursue my dream of being a solo developer and build something useful. (Now or never!)  
  
After looking at problems I wished someone had solved already, I niched down on the Google Calendar <> Slack relationship as I felt I can add recurring value here. I'm looking to plug the gaps left by Google Calendar for Teams, and I’d love to talk with folks who currently use the current Google Calendar integration in Slack. 

Right now I’m doubling down on making daily and weekly summaries truly useful:

* **Multi-channel destinations:** Deliver different digests to different channels (e.g. team channel vs. project channel).
* **Richer event information:** Include attendee lists, meeting duration, location/maps, dial-in links, and custom tags.
* **Practical time windows:** Offer more flexible windows beyond “Today/Tomorrow/This Week,” such as “Next 24 hours,” “Past 5 days,” or any custom date range.

**Who I’m looking for:**

* Slack users on teams who rely on Google Calendar events (shared primarily).
* Folks frustrated by the retiring “Google Calendar for Teams” app or seeking similar functionality.
* Users open to a short video call or phone call at a convenient time.

**What you’ll get:**

* A **20 USD Amazon gift card** for a 30 minute chat.
* Early access to try out the new bot once it’s live.

**How it works:**

1. **Sign up** via this form: [👉 Short signup form](<tally.so...>
2. I’ll email you to schedule a quick call
3. After our chat, I’ll send your $20 Amazon gift card code

  
No sales pitch. Just product research to build something that actually helps teams stay on top of shared calendars in Slack.

If you’re interested, please fill out the form above or reply to this post. Feel free to ask any questions here or via DM.  
  
Thanks in advance for your help!

"Account Management, User Interface","reddit","Feel free to answer regarding any aspect of Slack but i'm personally curious about a few things:

1. The account/workspaces/app hierarchy. Right now if i understand it correctly, even if you use the same email, each workspace has a separate login and you can use a different password for each one. But if you have authenticated/signed in to multiple ones for the same email they are associated with that email and unless you log out you can access each one or add them to the app without having to log out of another workspace. But the app can also have spaces associated with different email addresses. Is there a better way to do it? Would creating a slack account with a single username/password which you then associate workspaces with be better? Is this how discord does it? And what else if any could be done better?
2. Interface. I no longer remember what the design was before the last big change but i recall most people including myself didn't love it. How was it different before? And/or what would you change in the current design/layout to make it better?
3. Pricing i think is an obvious one. I would personally prefer almost anything to per user per month but i wonder what is a reasonable structure? What would be a good price per user bracket (up to 10, 50, 100, 500 users, etc)? Is there a different structure that would be better?
4. Are there any discord features you wish existed in Slack?

"","reddit","Hey,

We currently have a workflow built via the Deno SDK that allows users to submit a form, and then it posts a message to a channel. This works well, but we also want to add an item to a list (along with some of the info from the form) when this happens.

It doesn't seem like there is a (standard) way to do this in the SDK. So, I was thinking of updating our workflow to add some metadata to the message it posts, then creating a custom trigger that listens for that metadata - hoping to then use this trigger in the workflow builder to utilise the ""Add item to a list"" step that it has.

However, I can't seem to get the trigger created such that it's an option in the ""Start the workflow... Choose an event"" option when in the workflow builder. `slack trigger create` goes through fine, but it's not visible in the list.

Has anyone tried anything similar? Open to other ideas and suggestions.

Thanks :)","2025-05-19T11:03:23.000Z","83438944","https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/1kq8vl7/","I am trying to add an item to a list via the Deno SDK but am having trouble creating a custom trigger for the workflow builder.","","Raw entry text is not available for conversation transcripts in CSV exports","Neutral","Background_Shock_956","1kq8vl7","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"","reddit","Look, I absolutely **LOVE** Slack. It completely transformed how our team manages multiple sites and honestly, I can't imagine work without it. The communication and organization it enables is unmatched.

But here's what drives me nuts - how has Slack not developed a proper task management solution yet?!

We've been using Teamline, which is... fine, I guess? But we can't export tasks, the reminder functionality is limited, and there's no way to automatically import tasks from other sources. Plus, it hasn't seen meaningful updates in forever, despite the not-so-small price tag.

And please don't suggest ClickUp, Todoist, Asana, or Monday - we've tried them. They're all comprehensive PM platforms that essentially want us to abandon Slack and move everything into their ecosystem. Not happening! Nothing touches Slack for our site-by-site project management needs.

So here's my challenge to Slack: **PLEASE** build a proper task manager with desktop and mobile apps! You don't need to compete with full PM platforms - you've already won the communication game. Just give us a functional task manager that works seamlessly with what we already love!

"","reddit","Since about 14th May 2025, Slack is auto switching my BOSE BT headphones from Stereo -> Mono -> Stereo when I
- switch to another Workspace
- Go into my Preferences


I _feel like_ there's something going on in the code where it 'checks and resets' the audio device on these modals/switches .. and in my case .. is enumerating through all the BT settings for my headphones?

** ITS REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY ANNOYING **

(I'm switching between Workspaces all the time)

Tech info
- Slack via Windows Store
- Windows 11
- I've not done any changes to my hardware, especially my Audio.
- I don't see any driver issues
- Please don't be a troll and suggest ""update windows. update drivers. clear cache, blah blah newbie crap, etc"".

\- How do you currently avoid rewriting things over and over?

\- What’s annoying about how you handle these messages today?

"Notifications","reddit","Hey Slack folks,

Curious how others are handling this: if your team’s on Slack all day, how are you staying updated on customer calls and SMS?

I’m helping build a tool called KrispCall, and we just rolled out a Slack integration that pipes real-time call and SMS alerts into specific channels — no more switching tabs or missing updates.

It’s been helpful for teams in sales and support, but we’d love to hear from more Slack-heavy teams on what would make it even better.

We’re offering 3 months of KrispCall free to early users who are open to trying it and giving feedback.

 No catch — we just want to learn from real-world users before scaling this further.
Would love to hear your setup too — how are you currently managing these notifications?","2025-05-12T03:52:48.000Z","82790304","https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/1kkj9gq/","I am looking for feedback on how to improve our tool KrispCall, which offers real-time call and SMS alerts in Slack channels, and we are offering 3 months free to early users for feedback.","","Raw entry text is not available for conversation transcripts in CSV exports","Neutral","anubhav_afc","1kkj9gq","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Messaging","reddit","Been thinking a bit lately about how we handle things in Slack specifically around status updates and daily standups. My team like many others I guess uses it for sharing progress and blockers either async in a channel or sometimes quick huddles.

Don't get me wrong Slack is great for quick communication and staying connected. But sometimes preparing my update reading through everyone elses and then maybe having follow up questions... it feels like it takes a solid chunk out of the morning. A lot of context switching I think. Its time that could be spent you know actually doing the work. Especially for tasks that require deep focus. Seems like everyone is always busy reporting what they're doing instead of just doing it.

Does anyone else here using Slack for engineering teams feel this way? How have your teams found ways to make status updates less of a time sink?

"","reddit","As is widely known on this forum, Skype has ceased to be a viable option for internal communications. Prior to Skype's discontinuation, we embarked on a search for a replacement. Our initial exploration led us to Slack. 

Our company comprises ten individuals, and the sole feature that Slack lacks compared to Skype is the ability to remotely control another person's screen. While this limitation was acceptable, we opted to utilize the trial version. After completing the trial period, we made the decision to proceed with Slack as no other alternative was discovered. 

A big problem with Slack is when in a channel and you have X number of channel members and you want to have a group discussion and you hit the huddle button, it does not ring everybody's computer and let them know they're wanted in a huddle. ⁠This, to us, is a serious problem. And another issue with notification is when you start a huddle with somebody, yes, it rings their computer for a while, but it's not in their face. Hey, you've got to answer this. ⁠

However, as we progressed, a growing number of my users encountered issues. Consequently, it was determined that Teams, despite its heavier client, would be a more suitable solution. Consequently, I contacted Slack to request a prorated refund for the remaining time on our yearly contract. Unfortunately, Slack refused to provide any form of refund. Despite escalating this matter to a billing manager, I have yet to receive a response from Slack. They appear to be steadfast in their refusal to honor our request for a refund, which is in contrast to my experiences with other companies that promptly refund the prorated balance of a contract. If anyone has any suggestions or insights regarding this matter, I would be grateful for your assistance.

Thank you

"Integrations","reddit","Why we built it:

In every company, tons of valuable insights, decisions, and explanations live inside Slack threads. But once buried, they’re basically lost. We kept finding ourselves digging through Slack to find that one message from 3 weeks ago.

# What it does:

* Connect a Slack channel to a Notion page
* Automatically extract relevant conversations and threads
* Use AI (no leaks) to summarize and structure them into readable, organized content
* Keep the Notion page synced over time

# Who it’s for:

* **Teams using Slack** with **Notion, Confluence (or any tool used for internal documentation)** as their main tools
* **Engineering/product teams** who want to turn decisions & discussions into living documentation
* **Knowledge managers & ops folks** trying to reduce siloed info

We're still early but would love your feedback or ideas.

"Message Delivery, Notification Delivery, Notifications, Messaging, Notification Content, Channels, Message Organization","reddit","Hi all, hoping for a stroke of genius from someone here! Work for a mid size (50 person) law firm, and we forward all payment notifications to a single channel (via payment processor email notifications to the channel email).  

We have a dedicated channel for every client/case, and want to also post these notifications to those channels. Eg, our #incoming-funds channel post a notification of a payment by Jane Doe, and we want to automatically forward that message to the #doe-jane case channel.   
  
Naming conventions are strict/consistent, always lastname-firstname for case channels. Payment notifications also almost always include names, with the last name being a 1:1 match for a corresponding channel 9/10 times.   
  
Very happy to put in work or pay to make this possible, but the lats time I tried (several years ago) it didn't seem realistic. Any ideas? Thanks for any advice!

"Messaging, Channels","reddit","I am considering using Slack for my small business. The main use would be for messaging between team members. Before, we were using Twitter/X as a communications tool. When a team member in the field had an update, they would send a tweet and each member of the admin team followed each team member, so the message would be relayed to each admin member. Twitter/X has become more difficult to use and our accounts keep getting flagged and shut down by their algorithms. 

I am hoping to switch to a new service like Slack. My main question is around posting messages to a channel or specific person in our company. Is there a way to set up a channel so that every team member can post to it, but only a select few members can actually see the messages? This seems to be a pretty niche case, but I wanted to see if it was possible.","2025-05-06T15:19:51.000Z","82791417","https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/1kg754n/","I am considering switching to Slack for my small business to improve communication between team members, as our current method using Twitter/X is becoming problematic with accounts getting flagged.

"File Sharing, Messaging, User Interface, Slackbot","reddit","edit: thank you for the suggestions guys! so far, nothing has been great or working for us. saw something about creating own slack bot where we can DM it or add it on channels, and it can mine answers from the organization conversations and our drive or docs. but it's quite overwhelming with the youtube videos and don't really know which one to choose. some integration websites or tools also have like a subscription thingy, which is not really what we want right now. any suggestions you might have for this?

hi! i'm trying to look for a bot on slack where we can ask questions and it answers based on previous conversation of our people or from our shared drives or docs. it's kinda hard to check on which is the best because we want it to be some kind of a wiki or knowledge base. we're not yet at that point where we have an integrated wiki for everything about our company so it's been really hard to answer questions one by one or forgot about mentioning something to new hires or the onboarding process, so we're trying to look for something like this that will help us. we also don't have the capacity to add info somewhere for the content, so we want to make use of this integration

so far, for google drive, I think gemini is doing that now,but the problem we have so far is that it's just on google drive and you have to be on a specific folder to ask and have an accurate answer. we do not want something like that. for slack AI, heard that it was not worth it? but can it possibly pull info fromshared drives not just for one person drive? we want to test out around 2-3 software

do you have any recommendations and if you don't mind, may you share your experiences with what you have with them so far? thank you so much in advance!","2025-05-06T00:01:35.000Z","82791422","https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/1kfqxbj/","I am looking for a bot on Slack that can answer questions based on previous conversations or shared drives, as we do not have a centralized wiki for our company's information yet.","","Raw entry text is not available for conversation transcripts in CSV exports","Neutral","SensitiveContract789","1kfqxbj","","","","","","Feature Request","","","","","","",""

"","reddit","Hey community 👋

Today I want to share anana, a Slack app that automatically recognizes positive actions in Slack.

anana integrates to your Slack workspace and uses AI to detect when people are helping others, sharing knowledge, or solving problems. It automatically awards points (🍍) and creates leaderboards to celebrate top contributors.

As a former team lead, I was frustrated by how hard it was to maintain consistent recognition. Great work would happen in Slack, but unless someone explicitly called it out, it often went unacknowledged. Anana solves this by removing the human bottleneck.

Anana is free to use. Feel free to check it out, feedback is always appreciated 🙌

"","reddit","I’m an indie developer exploring the idea of building a custom app for the Slack App Directory. My goal? To solve real pain points that users like you experience every day—or improve on third-party apps that just don’t quite hit the mark.

I’d love your input on things like:
- What annoys or slows you down when using Slack?

- Have you ever said, “I wish Slack could just do this”? What was it?

Your feedback will directly shape what I build. Let’s create something that actually makes Slack smoother, smarter, and more enjoyable to use.

Excited to hear your thoughts!

Cheers!

"","reddit","I have read countless posts regarding this issue, but none of it seems to be clicking in my brain.

  
We have a list: Projects with the following columns:  
Project ID  
Status  
Worked by  
Step 1 (checkbox)  
Step 2 (checkbox)  
Completed (checkbox)  
Date

The first workflow is just to add the item to the list and has only one field to enter: Project ID  
The status defaults to New and no other fields have any entry

So along comes person who is going to work the project.  They click another workflow (link) to Update the list.  It is going to update the list (by matching Project ID) and will allow the person working it to check Step 1 or 2 (Completed/Date to be a third workflow which I haven't started because it'll be the same problem), with Status defaulting to Pending and Worked by updated to whoever uses the WF.

No matter what I try, I can't figure out the combination of how to take the Project ID and match it to the Update.     I don't understand how Item ID relates.  I was able to create an Item ID column in the list and get the Slack-generated ID # into it, but then what?  I'm not using a slack emoji to kick the workflow, but rather a featured WF.

"Integrations, Messaging","reddit","Hey Slack fans,

Just wanted to quickly share something for teams that handle customer calls or SMS alongside their Slack workflows.

We recently launched a KrispCall + Slack integration — it sends real-time call and SMS notifications directly into your Slack channels. Super handy if you want to keep your communication centralized without switching apps all the time.

👉 To celebrate the launch, we’re offering 3 months of free KrispCall for anyone who connects it early and shares feedback.

No strings attached — just looking to get it into the hands of real users and learn from your experience.

If you’re curious, I’m happy to share more details or help set it up! (Mods, feel free to remove if this isn't allowed.)

Cheers!","2025-04-28T08:12:41.000Z","82791481","https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/1k9qdj5/","I wanted to share our new KrispCall + Slack integration for teams that handle customer calls or SMS, offering 3 months of free KrispCall for early adopters who provide feedback.","","Raw entry text is not available for conversation transcripts in CSV exports","Positive","anubhav_afc","1k9qdj5","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Messaging, User Interface","reddit","This has always bugged me about the android app (maybe iOS has the same issue, IDK), mainly because it's so inconsistent.

When I use the native Android share tool in some other app (for instance, sharing an image from an email), and choose Slack, Slack will always only suggest 10 total targets, and 9-10 of them are DMs and *sometimes* 1 is a channel. And it's never a channel I even frequent.

99% of time, I'm wanting to share to a channel, not a DM. But every time, I have to start typing in the search bar and then it'll show me filtered results across all channels and DMs.

What's frustrating is that I know it has shown me a complete list of channels and DMs in the past, but very rarely. I've never seen a setting that controls this. What's driving this behavior? I hardly ever DM in slack. Almost all of my activity is in channels.

Why doesn't it simply show me the 10 most recent channels/DMs?","2025-04-27T22:08:33.000Z","82791482","https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/1k9fx8x/","I am frustrated with the Android app's share-to behavior in Slack because it consistently suggests DMs instead of channels, making it difficult for me to share to the desired destination.","","Raw entry text is not available for conversation transcripts in CSV exports","Negative","pestojest","1k9fx8x","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I created a new channel in the Slack and I'd like to add every member of the entire membership group to the channel, since my understanding is that they won't see this channel until I add them (I think?). Since there are over 50 people I do not want to do this individually. I am just not figuring out how to do a bulk add. I've tried to:

1) copy the entire membership list and paste it into the new channel's membership list. I'm just not seeing where I can copy every member of the group. I've tried to do this in a default channel but I don't get any options to do it. Here are the directions I was trying to follow but I do not get the option ""copy member names.""

2) I tried to make my new channel a default channel in hopes that everyone would automatically be added. That does not seem to have happened either.

"Messaging","reddit","I actually work hybrid at a non profit. One of the things I struggle with is that the work really ebbs and flows between busy periods and more relaxed periods. I used to try and stay on slack 24/7 or whenever I said my availability was but quickly realized that was stupid because sometimes there's genuinely not enough work and also I wouldn't see all of my colleagues on Slack. Recently in a team meeting my manager said that my green dot on slack should always be on when my calendar says im available. I almost lost it. I have had issues with this manager nitpicking things in the past, and I feel like she will pounce on something small the second she feels like she's not in control. I am trying to message her my updates more so she's I'm doing work even though she can't see me.

I'm wondering if anyone else has struggled with this and if this would annoy anyone else too. The only hack I've found is to leave slack open on my phone and turn off the screen saver time so the dot is always green. When I'm done with my tasks for the day I just watch YouTube and stuff on my personal computer. I just think the slack activity thing is stupid because slack is just messaging there's other types of work you could be doing in different tabs. It's performative productivity.

**Problem:** I want employees from my company to have access to the client's workspace via Slack Connect, without having to switch between workspaces, which causes delays in communication.

**What I've done so far:**

* I managed to connect several channels (#random, #availability, #testing) between our workspaces
* However, I can't connect the most important channel: #general

**Error messages:**

* When the client (workspace admin) tried to invite me, he got the message: ""You can only add other people from XYZ for this channel""
* When trying another method: ""This person looks like they're from another company. This channel can't be shared with external people""

Based on that, I think that main channels in Slack are blocked by default to invite external users

Does anyone know how to share the #general channel via Slack Connect? How to change the permission? Is it even possible? Or should we create a new channel and encourage everyone to use it instead of #general?

Thanks in advance for your help!","2025-04-25T07:59:06.000Z","82791660","https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/1k7fhud/","I am having trouble sharing the #general channel via Slack Connect between my company and a client, and I need help figuring out how to change the permissions or if it's even possible.","","Raw entry text is not available for conversation transcripts in CSV exports","Neutral","Mammoth-Adeptness503","1k7fhud","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Integrations","reddit","Hey r/slack community,

I know the pain of brilliant ideas and action items getting lost in conversations, or the constant context-switching to manually create tasks in project management tools like Jira, Asana, Trello, etc.

That's why I built **Synxtra** – an AI agent that lives in your Slack workspace.

Here's the idea: Your team talks naturally in Slack. Synxtra's AI monitors relevant channels, recognizes when tasks or action items are discussed, captures the context and details, and automatically creates a structured task in your connected PM tool. It even links back to the original conversation.

Imagine:

* No more manually creating tasks after every decision.
* Critical action items are captured automatically.
* Project context stays linked.
* Your team stays in Slack, focused on the conversation, not the admin work.

I'm starting with Slack, Jira, and Asana, with plans for more integrations down the line.

I'm currently opening up **early access** spots. If you're tired of the manual project management burden in Slack, I'd love for you to check it out and help shape the future of Synxtra.

For context, I am a freelancer so I am not part of a company (I can completely understand how Slack may be a good alternative to Teams for instance). However, I am constantly recommended to join certain freelancer groups on Slack, but every time I do so, it asks me to create a new login. Is there no way to centralise it and jump between groups on one account? Or is the point that you commit to one? I'm just so confused!

"Messaging","reddit","Hey folks! My company is getting ready to onboard external users for a beta test, and we’d love to manage communication through a dedicated Slack channel.

We’re on Slack’s Pro plan, and I know full members and multi-channel guests are billed, but single-channel guests are free (with limits), and Slack Connect is also free. We already use Slack Connect a lot.

However, not all of our beta testers use Slack already, and we don’t want to incur charges or make them sign up for paid accounts just to join a test group.

Has anyone found a good workaround or clear limits to how many single-channel guests can be added for free? Or should I be looking at another tool entirely for mass communication with testers?

Appreciate any advice or experience shared 🙌","2025-04-23T23:01:30.000Z","82791666","https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/1k6d3ht/","I am looking for a way to onboard beta testers into a Slack channel without extra cost, as not all testers use Slack and we don't want to incur charges or make them sign up for paid accounts.","","Raw entry text is not available for conversation transcripts in CSV exports","Neutral","aaronorjohnson","1k6d3ht","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Integrations, Channels","reddit","TLDR : My company needs a slack Expert to help us set it up properly.

I've used discord for our company for years, and I've used slack with many clients, but we are now switching to using slack as our own company platform. I want to set it up so it has a pleasant onboarding experience for our clients as well as our staff. Would also like a bit of coaching on the ins and outs of the platform as I don't have the time to spend on watching a bunch of tutorials on Youtube and figuring things out myself.

I've looked on Fiver and Malt for slack experts but none of them quite fit my needs. Where could I find someone like this, or is anyone here capable of helping me out? (Payed of course, and I just need a good half day)

Key points that I need to master :  
\- Channel Permissions  
\- Inviting/ Onboarding clients VS Staff  
\- Slack project managment features (Lists, Canvas etc.)  
\- Creating an organized space for our company  
\- TRELLO Integration, we use trello to manage projects and clients.

"","reddit","Seriously, it's 2025. AI can write movies, we have real-time voice cloning, we can upscale a potato-quality photo into a 4K masterpiece, but **Slack still can’t figure out how to share system audio during screen sharing?**

We’re stuck paying for this ancient overpriced chat tool because it’s “the standard” for remote work now. And for what?

* Still no way to share computer sound on screen share (both Mac *and* PC).
* Huddles? Cool idea, except you can’t **enlarge video feeds**. Great.
* No persistent voice channels like Discord had **a decade ago**.
* Huddles randomly bug out and drop audio, and the “reconnect” button does nothing.
* Want to demo an app with sound? Haha, **better record a video and upload it manually**.

Why the hell is **Discord**, a free gamer chat app, miles ahead of Slack in basic communication UX?

Anyway—rant over.  
Does **anyone know of a third-party workaround** or app/plugin for sharing system audio on Slack screen share? I’m on both Mac and Windows.  
Not looking to route OBS into a virtual camera and 4 virtual audio devices just to get sound through. Something **clean**.

"","reddit","Hey Slack fam 👋

One of the little things I missed when we went remote?  
Those old-school birthday cards that got passed around the office.  
You know the ones—full of personal notes, inside jokes, even the occasional doodle.

We wanted to bring that feeling back… without the logistics nightmare. So we just launched **Virtual Celebration Cards** inside [CultureBot](<www.getculturebot.com...>)—a Slack-native app.

Here’s what it does:

💌 Teammates can write messages, doodle, or even record a short video  
🎉 Cards are automatically delivered in Slack for birthdays & workiversaries  
🔧 Super simple setup—no manual reminders or message chasing

It’s a small touch, but it makes a big difference for culture.

Here’s a [quick overview](<getculturebot.com...> if you're curious.

"Slack notification badges are not updating, Notification Badge Errors, Notifications, Notification Content, I am receiving false unread notifications, The badge count is incorrect","reddit","I’ve had this problem for over a month. For some reason, my slack app on my phone always say I have 340 notifications when I have 0. When I actually have some it will say 355 or something like that so in a way 340 is my new 0. 

If I go to the app and close it, the 340 number goes away but it always comes back

I tried deleting and reinstalling the app but that didn’t do anything.

Anyone have an idea on how to get rid of these ghost notification indicator? I’m on an iPhone if that makes a difference.

"Integrations, User Interface, Slackbot","reddit","Hey folks,

We’ve been working on **LockitBot** – a Slack-native bot that helps teams manage access to **shared resources** like dev environments, staging servers, test accounts, or even meeting rooms — all without leaving Slack.

It is currently used by 40 workspaces

You can ask it to:

🔐 “Lock staging-env-1 for 30 mins”  
📅 “Who has QA-env-2 right now?”  
🔁 “Auto-release this resource after 1 hour if idle”  
📢 “Notify me when the iOS device is free”

It’s great for dev, QA, or ops teams juggling limited resources — no more pinging threads or accidentally stepping on someone else’s session.

It also handles coordination at scale:

– Prevent double bookings with real-time locks  
– Set up auto-expiry and cooldown windows  
– Keep a full log of who used what, and when

No spreadsheets. No calendar juggling. Just type and lock.

We’re looking for feedback:

✅ Would this be useful for your team’s resource management?  
🔧 Any integration specifically you want to have?

I'm a big fan of productivity techniques such as the Ivy Lee method. I usually practice it in a simple doc or even handwritten paper.

Last week I had a few days off and decided to implement it through a Slack app, so that is better integrated with my workspace and I can give my team visibility.

Things is, they like to send slack messages, which are fine. But when I check them in the morning (my off hour before going to sleep or right after waking up), I want to be reminded again in 9PM (when I start my work).

The reminder only has 20 mins, 1H, 3H, tomorrow, and custom. So obviously I tried custom the first time I did it and chose 9PM. It works perfectly. Now, It's pain if I have to do this for all the messages, so I'd just set it to tomorrow and set the tomorrow time to 9PM.

Should work right? \*NO\*. Because it's still the same day. So it will remind me 9PM the next day (over 24H).

How do I do this? Is there any hack to this? Or will Slack fix this?

Everything I've read from Slack says that it can summarize and cite from PDFs, but I'm wondering if it can **cite and answer questions from large multi-hundred-page PDFs accurately**?

I’m curious if anyone has experience using **Slack AI** to handle this kind of task. Specifically:

* Can it process **large PDFs** (hundreds of pages) that are uploaded or linked in Slack?
* Can it answer questions based on the contents accurately?
* Can it **cite sources** (e.g., section titles or page numbers) when generating responses?

I’m trying to decide whether Slack AI can handle this out of the box, or if it would be better to build a custom solution using something like GPT-4, vector search, and document embeddings.

If you’ve tried using Slack AI for any kind of document-based Q&A, I’d love to hear how well it worked.

Thank you!","2025-04-11T16:00:37.000Z","82791927","https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/1jwtdxi/","I am exploring if Slack AI can accurately cite and answer questions from large PDFs shared in a workspace for my Slack bot assistant project.","","Raw entry text is not available for conversation transcripts in CSV exports","Neutral","IdioticHooten","1jwtdxi","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"Messaging","reddit","Estoy usando el plan gratuito de Slack por cuestiones de presupuesto, y algo que me genera inquietud es la visibilidad en la sección de Mensajes Directos. Al parecer, todos los miembros del workspace pueden verse entre sí, lo que significa que si tengo, por ejemplo, 10 clientes, ellos podrían enviarse mensajes directos sin restricciones.

Esta situación me preocupa porque no quiero que mis clientes se pongan a comunicarse entre sí, ya que puede generar confusión, malentendidos, o incluso problemas de competencia. Me parece que, desde una perspectiva de profesionalismo, tener a todos en el directorio visible podría afectar la imagen de mi agencia de marketing.

Mi pregunta es: ¿Alguien ha encontrado una forma de resolver este tema en Slack, o es algo inherente a la versión gratuita que simplemente hay que aceptar? ¿Cómo manejan ustedes esta limitación en sus entornos de trabajo?

It’s frustrating. I’ve gone through settings and allowed all options, but the buttons simply aren’t there for me. Additionally, if you’re in more than one Slack workspace, it turns off notifications for the other workspace. I know there’s a feature to prevent this by allowing cross-workspace notifications, but that still doesn’t always work. They’re two pretty important aspects of a workplace communication workspace that I find concerningly absent!! Other than that Slack is great!!","2025-03-21T20:44:25.000Z","82779515","","I love Slack, but I'm frustrated that I can't upload files from my phone and that notifications turn off for other workspaces.",4,"Raw entry text is not available for conversation transcripts in CSV exports","Negative","jjfouquette","12448995289","","","","","","","25.03.30","4","iOS","Slack","","",""

"Notification Delivery, Notifications","appstore","Our company recently switched over to Slack. Handful of issues right off the bat. Whenever someone replies to an item in a list that I have previously been tagged in, whether or not they are trying to mention me, I still get a notification. No way to change that. Searching for items in the list requires that I go to a specific search field within the correct channels, instead of letting me search from the main search on the Home Screen. We search for items every single time we pick up the corresponding asset, so that’s going to = thousands of additional “taps” over the work year. Lists are janky and not very information-dense, so viewing these at a glance is a struggle. We had to come up with a workflow to provide updates to a feed chronologically, otherwise there would be no visibility on when tasks are created or completed. Normally this all happens quietly behind the scenes. I am not a manager, thankfully, because this app is giving me headaches with how bad the task management is.

"","appstore","Если вы ищете приложение для общения, которое напоминает утюг, который вместо глажки просто жжет ваши вещи, то Slack – это именно то, что вам нужно! Это совершенно неудобное и ненадежное приложение, которое выглядит так, как будто его дизайнеры решили, что хаос – это новая структура. Каждый раз, когда я открываю Slack, у меня появляется стойкое ощущение, что меня пытаются запутать еще больше. Иконки мчатся по экрану, как куры, сбежавшие с фермы, а сообщения текут, словно река, без берега – вы никогда не знаете, где ваше сообщение потерялось и каким образом вы вернулись в 2007 год. Каждое обновление этого приложения похоже на попытку перевести слона через вокзал: много шума и бесполезных изменений, которые абсолютно не решают проблему. Зачем просто улучшать функциональность, если можно добавить еще несколько кнопок и настроек, которые, возможно, никто не поймет?! Мой мозг, как Лемур, который пытается собрать пазл из 1000 кусочков, застрял в попытках разобраться, где же эта чертовска новая опция. А еще ожидание загрузки – это как ждать, когда начнется дождь в пустыне: всегда кажется, что вот-вот начнется, но вместо этого вы просто сидите с пустым приложением и надеетесь, что кто-то другой решит дождаться. Надежность Slack так же высока, как у гриба в темном лесу — вы никогда не знаете, чем это закончится. В итоге, если вы ищете приложение, которое заставит вас почувствовать себя как в бесконечном лабиринте из полного недопонимания и постоянного стресса, то Slack вам идеально подойдет. Но если вам нужна стабильная работа и комфортное взаимодействие – прощайтесь с этой модернистской головоломкой! Я, как и многих из вас, не рекомендую Slack, и мир точно станет немножко лучше без этого цифрового хаоса.","2025-02-25T01:17:28.000Z","82789547","","If you are looking for a communication app that feels like an iron burning your clothes instead of ironing them, then Slack is the perfect fit for you, but if you want stability and comfortable interaction, say goodbye to this modernist puzzle!",1,"Raw entry text is not available for conversation transcripts in CSV exports","Negative","Лебедев-кумач","12352587906","","","","","","","25.02.31","1","iOS","Slack","","",""
